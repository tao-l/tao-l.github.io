Our main result shows that optimal contests in the monopolistic setting (i.e., those that maximize the sum of efforts in a model with a single contest) form an equilibrium in the model with competition among contests. Under a very natural assumption these contests are in fact dominant, and the equilibria that they form are unique. Moreover, equilibria with the optimal contests are Pareto-optimal even in cases where other equilibria emerge. In many natural cases, they also maximize the social welfare.","tags":["working"],"title":"From Monopoly to Competition: Optimal Contests Prevail","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608681600,"objectID":"e3aa003e446f3ded3f189aff65b4663e","permalink":"/talk/erm-itcs/","publishdate":"2021-10-10T20:16:02-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/erm-itcs/","section":"talk","summary":" Empirical Revenue Maximization (ERM) is an important price learning algorithm in data-driven auction design.

Using the First Price Auction as our main demonstrating example, we show that Õ (n/ϵ^2) samples from the prior with n agents suffice for an algorithm to learn the interim utilities for all monotone bidding strategies. As a consequence, this number of samples suffice for learning all approximate equilibria. We give almost matching (up to polylog factors) lower bound on the sample complexity for learning utilities. We also consider a setting where agents must pay a search cost to discover their own types. Drawing on a connection between this setting and the first price auction, discovered recently by Kleinberg et al. (2016), we show that Õ (n/ϵ^2) samples suffice for utilities and equilibria to be estimated in a near welfare-optimal descending auction in this setting. En route, we improve the sample complexity bound, recently obtained by Guo et al. (2020), for the Pandora's Box problem, which is a classical model for sequential consumer search.","tags":["published"],"title":"Learning Utilities and Equilibria in Non-Truthful Auctions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaotie Deng","Tao Lin","Tao Xiao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585408956,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585408956,"objectID":"b0db6125d8ecbad0488fe0e43842da9c","permalink":"/publication/pdm/","publishdate":"2020-03-28T23:22:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pdm/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we revisit the sponsored search auction as a repeated auction. We view it as a learning and exploiting task of the seller against the private data distribution of the buyers. We model such a game between the seller and buyers by a Private Data Manipulation (PDM) game: the auction seller first announces an auction for which allocation and payment rules are based on the value distributions submitted by buyers. The seller’s expected revenue depends on the design of the protocol and the game played among the buyers in their choice on the submitted (fake) value distributions. Under the PDM game, we re-evaluate the theory, methodology, and techniques in the sponsored search auctions that have been the most intensively studied in Internet economics.","tags":["published"],"title":"Private Data Manipulation in Optimal Sponsored Search Auction","type":"publication"}]
