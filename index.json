This problem generalizes the seminal Bayesian Persuasion framework and is ubiquitous in computational economics, multi-agent learning, and machine learning with multiple objectives. The core solution concept here is the Nash equilibrium of senders' signaling policies. Theoretically, we prove that finding an equilibrium in general is PPAD-Hard; in fact, even computing a sender's best response is NP-Hard. Given these intrinsic difficulties, we turn to finding local Nash equilibria. We propose a novel differentiable neural network to approximate this game's non-linear and discontinuous utilities. Complementing this with the extra-gradient algorithm, we discover local equilibria that Pareto dominates full-revelation equilibria and those found by existing neural networks. Broadly, our theoretical and empirical contributions are of interest to a large class of economic problems.","tags":["information design","machine learning","computational complexity"],"title":"Multi-Sender Persuasion: A Computational Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Tao Lin_","Yiling Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1718766185,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718766185,"objectID":"82971d887eba7abe74f71511d040b9e3","permalink":"/publication/learning-agent-bp/","publishdate":"2024-02-15T22:03:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-agent-bp/","section":"publication","summary":"We study a repeated Bayesian persuasion problem (and more generally, any generalized principal-agent problem with complete information) where the principal does not have commitment power and the agent uses algorithms to learn to respond to the principal's signals.

This reduction allows us to show that: if the agent uses contextual no-regret learning algorithms, then the principal can guarantee a utility that is arbitrarily close to the principal's optimal utility in the classic non-learning model with commitment; if the agent uses contextual no-swap-regret learning algorithms, then the principal cannot obtain any utility significantly more than the optimal utility in the non-learning model with commitment. The difference between the principal's obtainable utility in the learning model and the non-learning model is bounded by the agent's regret (swap-regret).

The signals of the experts and the outcome of the event follow a joint distribution that is unknown to the principal, but the principal has access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution, where each sample is a tuple of the experts' reports (not signals) and the realization of the event. Using these samples, the principal aims to find an ε-approximately optimal aggregator, where optimality is measured in terms of the expected squared distance between the aggregated prediction and the realization of the event. We show that the sample complexity of this problem is at least Ω̃ (mn−2/ε) for arbitrary discrete distributions, where m is the size of each expert's signal space. This sample complexity grows exponentially in the number of experts n. But, if the experts' signals are independent conditioned on the realization of the event, then the sample complexity is significantly reduced, to Õ (1/ε2), which does not depend on n. Our results can be generalized to non-binary events. The proof of our results uses a reduction from the distribution learning problem and reveals the fact that forecast aggregation is almost as difficult as distribution learning.

We study a relaxation of the Bayesian persuasion model where the receiver can approximately best respond to the sender's signaling scheme.

Together, (1) and (2) imply that the approximately best-responding behavior of the receiver does not affect the sender's maximal achievable utility a lot in the Bayesian persuasion problem. The proofs of both results rely on the idea of robustification of a Bayesian persuasion scheme: given a pair of the sender's signaling scheme and the receiver's strategy, we can construct another signaling scheme such that the receiver prefers to use that strategy in the new scheme more than in the original scheme, and the two schemes give the sender similar utilities. As an application of our main result (1), we show that, in a repeated Bayesian persuasion model where the receiver learns to respond to the sender by some algorithms, the sender can do almost as well as in the classic model. Interestingly, unlike (2), with a learning receiver the sender can sometimes do much better than in the classic model.","tags":["information design","machine learning","online learning"],"title":"Persuading a Behavioral Agent: Approximately Best Responding and Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Tao Lin_"],"categories":["notes"],"content":"","date":1670992894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670992894,"objectID":"b999cc4218c7e2b8d9f682e5f395561b","permalink":"/publication/sample-erm-product/","publishdate":"2021-10-11T00:41:34-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sample-erm-product/","section":"publication","summary":"While many classical notions of learnability (e.g., PAC learnability) are distribution-free, utilizing the specific structures of an input distribution may improve learning performance. For example, a product distribution on a multi-dimensional input space has a much simpler structure than a correlated distribution. A recent paper [GHTZ21] shows that the sample complexity of a general learning problem on product distributions is polynomial in the input dimension, which is exponentially smaller than that on correlated distributions. However, the learning algorithm they use is not the standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. In this note, we characterize the sample complexity of ERM in a general learning problem on product distributions. We show that, even though product distributions are simpler than correlated distributions, ERM still needs an exponential number of samples to learn on product distributions, instead of a polynomial. This leads to the conclusion that a product distribution by itself does not make a learning problem easier – an algorithm designed specifically for product distributions is needed.","tags":["machine learning","mechanism design"],"title":"How Does Independence Help Generalization?

We completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, in terms of convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in two senses: (1) time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium approaches 1 in the limit; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of bidders approaches a Nash equilibrium in the limit.  Specifically, the results depend on the number of bidders with the highest value:\n- If the number is at least three, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, both in time-average and in last-iterate.\n- If the number is two, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily in last-iterate.\n- If the number is one, the bidding dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average nor in last-iterate.\nOur discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of convergence dynamics of learning algorithms.","tags":["mechanism design","auction theory","machine learning","online learning"],"title":"Nash Convergence of Mean-Based Learning Algorithms in First Price Auctions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manon Revel","_Tao Lin_","Daniel Halpern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643689039,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643689039,"objectID":"a2c42c6616e15e212469e2e319d56b0e","permalink":"/publication/congress/","publishdate":"2021-10-11T00:17:19-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/congress/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze the optimal size of a congress in a representative democracy.

Under such market-clearing prices, a maximum matching is formed when buyers buy their most preferred products respectively. We study the property of market-clearing prices without the use of duality, showing that: (1) the space of market-clearing prices is convex and closed under element-wise maximum and minimum operations; (2) any market-clearing prices induce all maximum matchings.","tags":["matching market"],"title":"On Clearing Prices in Matching Markets: A Simple Characterization without Duality","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" This is a note about market-clearing prices in a matching market, where we prove that: (1) the space of market-clearing prices is convex; (2) the space of market-learning prices is closed under element-wise maximum and minimum operations; (3) any market-clearing prices induce all maximum matchings.
